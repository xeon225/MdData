Early work involved in website development. Use Asp.net PHP mysql development mode. After that, I was engaged in fronted development of HTML + CSS + JS for almost 10 years

In the past five years, I focused on html5 + CSS3 + VUE development and component development. I used SASS structure layout to generate style library similar to CMUI and cooperated with SVG Sprite to create font library. On this basis, various UI components and interactive functional components are developed. The goal is to develop a set of fronted UI framework CLI.

Personally, I prefer UI fronted direction, and develop adaptive cross-platform CSS3 framework or UI class library by using SASS structure layout and VUE, which can be applied to PC, mobile and small programs.
